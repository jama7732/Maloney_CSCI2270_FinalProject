CSCI 2270 Final Project Phase 1 Writeup

For this assignment I am going to utilize a graph in a situation in which the user has some specified ammount of time or money to traverse the world
and the goal is to make it around the world in either the shortest or the longest ammount of time. The other data structure I will use is a BST that will
sort the various destinations from least to most expensive in either time or price commitment. I may also include a doublly linked list that is similar to the
communication network assignment where the user can find the shortest path from two destinations and send that message via a doubly linked list between
these destinations. I will use the BFS path to find trhe shortest path and create the DLL from that
